We utilized D3.js to visualize over 30,000 patents in a timeline format and allowed viewers to scroll and search for patents. The viewer can select the individual patent to reveal more detailed information about a particular patent. We also showcased the story of Qualcomm over the years with a story overlay that is also interactive.",

Dynamic D3 scrolling that gives the application the ability to work even on a mobile device. Also creation of a CMS that allows Qualcomm to update all aspects of the application from stories to the patents themselves.",

These voltage changes can be used to classify different mental states with the help of machine learning.

Using these methods, I was able to build a P300 speller which would allow a person to spell words and make sentences by mentally acknowledging when the letter they want is highlighted on screen.",
